# Driver Monitoring Dataset (DMD)
The [Driver Monitoring Dataset](http://dmd.vicomtech.org/) is the largest visual dataset for real driving actions, with footage from synchronized multiple cameras (body, face, hands) and multiple streams (RGB, Depth, IR) recorded in two scenarios (real car, driving simulator). Different annotated labels related to distraction, fatigue and gaze-head pose can be used to train Deep Learning models for Driver Monitor Systems.

This project include a tool to annotate the dataset, inspect the annotated data and export training sets (in progress). Output annotations are formatted using [VCD (Video Content Description)](https://vcd.vicomtech.org/) language.

## Dataset details
More details of the recording and video material of DMD can be found at the [official website](http://dmd.vicomtech.org/)

## Available tools:
- Temporal Annotation Tool (TaTo) - (more info [here](annotation-tool/README.md)) 

### Annotation Instructions
We have detailed descriptions of how the action annotations should be done:

- [Distraction-related actions]()

## Credits
Development of DMD was supported and funded by the European Commission (EC) Horizon 2020 programme (project [VI-DAS](http://www.vi-das.eu/), grant agreement 690772)
